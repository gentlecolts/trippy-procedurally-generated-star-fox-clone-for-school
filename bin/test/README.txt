in its current state, the program will likely fail to load images and is likely unstable
in the likely event that it fails to load images, it will show a black screen when it starts up, just click the screen, it should start, but could occasionally crash

controls:
arrow keys or wasd - move
enter - shoot
' (single quote) - fire bomb (you have 4)
space - boost (doesnt do much yet, but does look cool)

bugs all over the place though, sorry
